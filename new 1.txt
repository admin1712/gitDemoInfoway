 of the project :
-- has array to store objects of any
 class(Student or CollegeStudent, SchoolStudent)
--create two CollegeStudent  and three SchoolStudent
 record objects and store them inside the array
-- display all record from the array
-- search record on the basic of rollno and check given rollno is of SchoolStudent or of CollegeStudent.
--count how many students are having A grade,  if for A grade percentage >75
